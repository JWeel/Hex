# Hex

This project is a personal sandbox where I work on various game formats and extend MonoGame with custom components.

Feel free to look around at the code, but keep in mind that this is a sandbox - it is not done and likely never will be. It is something that continuously evolves as I work on in only a few times each year, when inspiration hits me.

It is called _Hex_ because it started as a GUI built around hexagonal grids.
